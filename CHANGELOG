## Release v0.2.0
- The use of `libm` in `#[no-std]` environments is now opt-in by enabling the `libm` feature.
- If the `libm` is not enabled in a `#[no-std]` environment, then no `RealField` or `ComplexField` impls will be provided for floats.
- Add the `libm_force` cargo feature that forces the use of `libm`, even when we don't target `no-std`.
- Add `copysign` to copy the sign from one number to another.
- Add `simd_horizontal_min`, `simd_horizontal_max` to compute the min/max among the lanes of a single SIMD number.
- Wrap all SIMD bools from `packed_simd` into our own `Simd<_>` newtype.
